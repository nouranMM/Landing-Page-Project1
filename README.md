Landing Page Project
-----------------------------------
The Structure:

My Landing Page have the structure that Udasity want:
1. HTML File ----- index.html.
2. Javascript File ----- app.js
3. CSS File ----- style.css
4. Readme.md.

- I make the landing page with at least 4 sections.
- I build the navigation bar in app.js file dynamically as an unordered list. Start with empty <ul> and build dynamically navigation and <li> and <a> inside each <li> using forEach, append, appendChild, and innerHTML and with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.
- I make the page can scroll by scrollIntoView() function by searching on internet and I found it on MDN
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView 
and getBoundingClientRect()
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect

- I made each section is active.
- I made some changes in style.css file to change colors.

- Comments are present and effectively explain longer code procedures.

- Code is formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting.

- At the end,i hope that my project was implemented correctly and according to your expectations.
